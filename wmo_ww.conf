#                WMO 94 BUFR CODE TABLE. Extracted from
#                BUFRCREX_29_0_0_CodeFlag_en.txt (downloaded Jan 2018

#
#                FORMAT: the left hand side of the setting can
#                be whatever you like, except that on "=" can be
#                in the description. The right hand side has to be
#                of the format "<integer> gets <integer>" or 
#                "<integer> gets <None>". Everything else will be
#                ignored.
#                The right hand side means nothing else than:
#                If BUFR message is "10" it gets a "0" in synop
#                weather type representation. Or whatever you define.
#
#                PLEASE NOTE: if a flag is defined more than once
#                only the last will be used which might get confusing.
#                Take care to make unique definitions!
