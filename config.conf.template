# - AUTHOR:      Reto Stauffer
# - DATE:        2014-07-07
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# - DESCRIPTION: Template for the config.conf file. By default the
#                config file is expected to be named config.conf
#                in the same directory as the python scripts.
#                You can start making a copy of this file and adjust
#                the settings (mainly mysql config).
#
#                cp config.conf.template config.conf
#                vim config.conf # edit the settings

# - IMPORTANT: name of the current judgingclass. The
#   judgingclass is the script which computes the points
#   for the players. There are two scripts, one is
#   the ComputePoints routine, the other one is a test
#   routine called TestPoints. For development purpses
#   you can set them separately (e.g., develop a new
#   judginglcass, test it with TestPoints before
#   you use the new judgingclass for the live points
#   in ComputePoints).
#   judgingclasses are Python modules located in the
#   PyModule directory identified by a file named
#   'judgingclassYYYYMMDD.py' where the config here
#   defines the 'YYYYMMDD'.
