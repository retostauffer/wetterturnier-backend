# - AUTHOR:      Reto Stauffer
# - DATE:        2015-08-02
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# - DESCRIPTION: This is an example file for the autosubmit.py
#                script. The script submits wetterturnier.de
#                forecasts by script (e.g., for MOS systems).
#
#                This is a simple ASCII file with a required fixed
#                format read by python. If the format is wrong,
#                the script will stop. So please be aware to follow
#                this format if you would like to use such a text
#                file to submit your data.
#
#                Comments are indicated by "#" and can be added
#                or removed as you like. They are not critical.
#                Same yields for blank lines.
#
#                Please note that the order of the elements within
#                the section does not matter (a section is indicated
#                by a keyword in [] brackets). Moreover the
#                parameter names are not case sensitive (e.g.,
#                Rr_1, RR_1, or rr_1 will be ok).

# .... note that this is just an example. To place a propper bet
#      you have to fill in ALL required parameters (required by
#      the city you are submitting to). The autosubmit script
#      (actually the bad twin on the server side) will react
#      with an error if (i) parameters are missing, (ii) parameters
#      are empty or (iii) forecast days are missing.
#      You'll get a nice readable error message (as I hope) to solve
#      the problems as quick as possible. If not, please let me know
#      what wasn't working.
#      - Send this config file
#      - Let me know when you have sent the bet (plus minus)
#      - If you have the output of this script include the log
#      - ... or explain what the script told you.
#      At the moment to: reto.stauffer@uibk.ac.at. Thx
