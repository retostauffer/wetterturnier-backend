migration classes
=================

.. note:: These classes are just here in the doct for completeness.
    The two classes below have been used to migrate the data from
    the old wetterturnier system into the new one.
    They are not properly documented and please **do not use these classes**.
    as they are not made for operational use, but specifically designed for
    data migration for `Wetterturnier.de <http://www.wetterturnier.de>`_.


.. todo:: Remove these files in the near future.
